 The first use of `foo' was during World War II, when unknown aircraft were
 referred to as `Foo Fighters'.
 Another related term was

\begin_layout Quote
The etymology of hackish `foo' is obscure.
 When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the WWII-era
 Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later bowdlerized
 to foobar.
 It has been plausibly suggested that FUBAR was influenced by German `furchtbar'
 (terrible).
 It has also been reported out that 1960s computer manuals, in a usage influence
d by Fortran's implicit-declaration feature, frequently used F00 (F followed
 by two zeros) in examples.

 has picked up on the use of `foo' to stand for something, any element but
 no specific element.
 It sits outside the syntax of any language (including English) and is able
 to describe the syntax, hence the meta-syntatic nature of the word.
