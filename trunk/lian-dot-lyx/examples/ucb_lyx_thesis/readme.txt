I'm assuming you have gotten the UC Boulder thesis latex stuff from:
http://www.colorado.edu/its/docs/latex/thesis/
and put it somewhere Miktex can find it (remember to refresh FNDB).
That works great if you like latex, but if you want to use Lyx, you need to do a bit more.

On windows, I recommend you install the alternate Lyx installer (LyxWinInstaller):
http://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows
I downloaded the file "LyX-155-3-24-AltInstaller-Complete.exe"

You need to put the *.layout files into your Lyx layouts folder. Mine is at:
C:\Program Files\LyX 1.5.5\Resources\layouts\
Open Lyx and under the Tools menu, select "reconfigure"

Restart Lyx and you should be able to open the Mythesis.lyx file and click on the pdf button!
