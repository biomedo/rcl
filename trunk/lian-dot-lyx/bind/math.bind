# This file provides math mode keys.  Most were suggested by John Weiss
# and modified by Alejandro Aguilar Sierra to be used with different
# keyboard layouts.
#
# This file is automatically included from the main bind file.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS BINDING FILE! It will be replaced
# with every new install of LyX and your changes will be lost.
# Instead, copy it to ~/.lyx/bind/math.bind and modify that copy.

# Note that the order of these is important.  If you put the bindings
# that need "period" and "parenleft" first, they flood the minibuffer
# and make the keybinding hints impossible to read.  That's why they're
# at the end.
