In this repository there is a colletion of my personal snippets for
many different modes.

If you would like to try them
git clone 

they are usable by [[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][yasnippet]] and to try them out
1. install yasnippet
2. clone this repository with *git clone git://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets.git*
3. add to your .emacs the following
   - (add-to-list 'yas/root-directory "$DIRECTORY_WHERE_YOU_CLONED")
   - (yas/initialize)

and it should be all :)
