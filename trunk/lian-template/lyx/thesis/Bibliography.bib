@article{Ulrich1998,
abstract = {In this study, we investigate if finite element (FE) analyses of human trabecular bone architecture based on 168 microm images can provide relevant information about the bone mechanical characteristics. Three human trabecular bone samples, one taken from the femoral head, one from the iliac crest, and one from the lumbar spine, were imaged with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) using a 28 microm resolution. After reconstruction the resolution was coarsened to 168 microm. First, all reconstructions were thresholded and directly converted to FE-models built of hexahedral elements. For the coarser resolutions of two samples, this resulted in a loss of trabecular connections and a subsequent loss of stiffness. To reduce this effect, a tetrahedral element meshing based on the marching cubes algorithm, as well as a modified hexahedron meshing, which thresholds the image such that load carrying bone mass is preserved, were employed. For each sample elastic moduli and tissue Von Mises stresses of the three different 168 microm models were compared to those from the hexahedron 28 microm model. For one sample the hexahedron meshing at 168 microm produced excellent results. For the other two samples the results obtained from the hexahedral models at 168 microm resolution were poor. Considerably better results were attained for these samples when using the mass-compensated or tetrahedron meshing techniques. We conclude that the accuracy of the FE-models at 168 microm strongly depends on the bone morphology, in particular its trabecular thickness. A substantial loss of trabecular connections during the hexahedron meshing process indicates that poor FE results will be obtained. In this case the tetrahedron or mass-compensated hexahedron meshing techniques can reduce the loss of connections and produce better results than the plain hexahedron meshing techniques.},

@article{Tran2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we highlight that when the extended finite element method (XFEM) is employed to model a microstructure in which inclusions are involved and the distance between two inclusions is small enough to be comparable with the mesh size, three numerical artefacts are induced, significantly affecting the convergence and accuracy of the numerical solution to the problem with such a microstructure. These artefacts are: (a) an artificial percolation of nearby inclusions; (b) an artificial distortion of phase domains; and (c) an enrichment deficiency. We propose to improve the XFEM/Level set method so as to avoid these artefacts. The new technique leading to this improvement uses one level set function for each inclusion and adds additional enrichment in an element whose support is cut by several interfaces. A local description of the multiple level sets is provided to avoid the storage of all level set functions. A simple integration rule is employed for numerical quadrature in elements cut by several interfaces. We show that the artefacts mentioned hereinbefore are circumvented in this framework. The performances of the method are demonstrated through benchmarks and examples applied to the homogenization of concrete materials in 2D and 3D cases. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Ulrich1999,
abstract = {Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture are important determinants for the mechanical properties of cancellous bone. Although BMD alone is a good predictor of average mechanical properties of cancellous bone, there remains unexplained variation in mechanical properties that might be due to missing information regarding bone microarchitecture. Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) structural analysis have provided possibilities for measuring a variety of structural indices to characterize bone microarchitecture. The objectives of this study were to calculate structural indices and elastic constants of human cancellous bone from different skeletal sites and to investigate the predictive value of different 3D structural indices for the elastic properties of bone. A total of 237 cancellous bone samples taken from the iliac crest, lumbar spine, femoral head, and calcaneus were imaged with a 3D microcomputed tomography (microCT) system. The segmented 3D images were used to calculate BV/TV, BS/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, Tb.N, and MII ratio and for microstructural finite-element (microFE) analysis to calculate Young's moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratios. A subgroup of "critical" specimens within each site was selected to represent specimens that could not be identified as osteoporotic or normal on the basis of BMD measurement alone. For these "critical" specimens, structural indices and elastic constants were correlated by means of linear multivariate regression analysis. It was found that the elastic constants clearly correlated better when one of the 3D structural indices was included as independent variable than when BV/TV was the only independent variable. Each of the examined structural indices could improve the correlation: the R2 values were maximally increased from 53\% (BV/TV alone) to 82\% (BV/TV and MIL ratio). The most effective indices, however, were not the same for the different skeletal sites. Even better correlations were found when more than one of the 3D structural indices were included as independent variables: the R2 values were maximally increased from 53\% (BV/TV alone) to 92\% (BV/TV, Tb.Sp, and MIL ratio). The prediction of elastic constants for cancellous bone samples is clearly improved when BV/TV is supplemented with 3D structural indices. These results suggest that the determination of mechanical properties of bone and the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be improved if, in addition to BMD, the 3D bone microarchitecture is assessed in vivo.},

abstract = {Finite element (FE) modelling based on data from three-dimensional high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging systems provides a non-invasive method to assess structural mechanics. Automated mesh generation from these voxel based image data can be achieved by direct conversion to hexahedron elements, however these model representations have jagged edges. This paper proposes an automated method to generate smoothed FE meshes from voxel-based image data. Mesh fairing processes are utilized that allow constraints that control the smoothing process, and are computationally efficient. Surfaces of the mesh on the exterior, as well as interfaces between two tissues, can be smoothed by varying fairing parameters and constraint criteria. The method was tested on a variety of real and simulated three-dimensional data sets, resulting in both hexahedron and tetrahedron meshes. It was shown that the fairing process is linearly related to the number of smoothing iterations, and that peak stresses are reduced in FE simulations of the smoothed models. Although developed for micro-CT data sets, this fast and reliable mesh smoothing method could be applied to any three-dimensional image data where node and element connectivity have been defined.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi-scale analysis method for heat transfer in heterogeneous solids is presented. The principles of the method rely on a two-scale computational homogenization approach which is applied successfully for the stress analysis of multi-phase solids under purely mechanical loading. The present paper extends this methodology to heat conduction problems. The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

Solids 38, 813–841 (1990)] for heterogeneous elastic bodies smaller than the representative volume and submitted to static or kinematic uniform boundary conditions are partly extended to the case of mixed boundary conditions. Apparent elastic modulus and compliance tensors denned through the energetic procedure on a single specimen are considered. Through a variational approach, it is shown that each of them is bounded on one side. For cases fulfilling the Hill condition, these apparent modulus and compliance tensors are reciprocals. This provides two-sided bounds on each one. In this case, for a body smaller than the representative volume, the apparent elasticity tensor for mixed boundary conditions falls between the tensors associated with the static and kinematic uniform boundary conditions. Illustrating examples are studied. Various possible fields of application and other extensions are considered.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to develop and test a semi-automated finite element mesh generation method using computed tomography (CT) image data of a canine radius. The present study employs a direct conversion from CT Hounsfield units to elastic moduli. Our method attempts to minimize user interaction and eliminate the need for mesh smoothing to produce a model suitable for finite element analysis. Validation of the computational model was conducted by loading the CT-imaged canine radius in four-point bending and using strain gages to record resultant strains that were then compared to strains calculated with the computational model. Geometry-based and uniform modulus voxel-based models were also constructed from the same imaging data set and compared. The nonuniform voxel-based model most accurately predicted the axial strain response of the sample bone (R(2)=0.9764).},

@article{HORGAN1994,
abstract = {Thin-walled structures, such as rifle barrels, rocket casings, helicopter blades and containment vessels, are often constructed of layers of anisotropic, filament or fiber-reinforced materials which must be designed to remain elastic. A proper assessment of end or edge effects in such structures is of fundamental technological importance. The extent to which local stresses, such as those produced by fasteners and at joints, can penetrate girders, beams, plates and shells must be understood by the designer. Thus a distinction must be made between global structural elements (where Strength of Materials or other approximate theories may be used) and local elements which require more detailed (and more costly) analyses based on exact elasticity. Moreover, it must be recognized that it is impossible, in general, to refine global approximate theories (such as various so-called higher-order plate and shell theories) without a simultaneous consideration of local effects. The neglect of end effects is usually justified by appeals to some form of Saint-Venant's principle, and years of experience with homogeneous isotropic elastic structures have served to establish this standard procedure. Saint-Venant's principle also is the fundamental basis for static mechanical tests of material properties. Thus property measurements are made in a suitable gage section where uniform stress and strain states are induced and local effects due to clamping of the specimen are neglected by an appeal to Saint-Venant's principle. Such traditional applications of Saint-Venant's principle require major modifications when strongly anisotropic and composite materials are of concern. For such materials, local stress effects persist over distances far greater than are typical for isotropic materials. In this paper, we describe some problems of static and dynamic elasticity where anisotropy induces such extended Saint-Venant end zones. The paper is a review and a comprehensive list of references is given to original work where details of the analysis may be found. The consideration of such extended end zones due to anisotropy is essential in the proper analysis and design of structures using advanced composite materials.},

abstract = {We introduce the homotopic alternating sequential filter as a new method for smoothing two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) objects in binary images. Unlike existing methods, our method offers a strict guarantee of topology preservation. This property is ensured by the exclusive use of homotopic transformations defined in the framework of digital topology. Smoothness is obtained by the use of morphological openings and closings by metric disks or balls of increasing radius, in the manner of an alternating sequential filter. The homotopic alternating sequential filter operates both on the object and on the background, in an equilibrated way. It takes an original image X and a control image C as input, and smooths X ``as much as possible\{''\} while respecting the topology of X and geometrical constraints implicitly represented by C. Based on this filter, we introduce a general smoothing procedure with a single parameter which allows to control the degree of smoothing. Furthermore, the result of this procedure presents small variations in response to small variations of the parameter value. We also propose a method with no parameter for smoothing zoomed binary images In 2D or 3D while preserving topology. (C) 2004 SPIE and IST.},

abstract = {A new finite element method is presented that features the ability to include in the finite element space knowledge about the partial differential equation being solved. This new method can therefore be more efficient than the usual finite element methods. An additional feature of the partition-of-unity method is that finite element spaces of any desired regularity can be constructed very easily. This paper includes a convergence proof of this method and illustrates its efficiency by an application to the Helmholtz equation for high wave numbers. The basic estimates for a posteriori error estimation for this new method are also proved.},

abstract = {This contribution presents an extended global derivative recovery for enriched finite element methods (FEMs), such as the extended FEM along with an associated error indicator. Owing to its simplicity, the proposed scheme is ideally suited to industrial applications. The procedure is based on global minimization of the L-2 norm of the difference between the raw strain field (C-1) and the recovered (C-0) strain field. The methodology engineered in this paper extends the ideas of Oden and Brauchli (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 1971: 3) and Hinton and Campbell (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 1974: 8) by enriching the approximation used for the construction of the recovered derivatives (strains) with the gradients of the functions employed to enrich the approximation employed for the primal unknown (displacements). We show linear elastic fracture mechanics examples, both in simple two-dimensional settings, and for a three-dimensional structure. Numerically, we show that the effectivity index of the proposed indicator converges to unity upon mesh refinement. Consequently, the approximate error converges to the exact error, indicating that the error indicator is valid. Additionally, the numerical examples suggest a novel adaptive strategy for enriched approximations in which the dimensions of the enrichment zone are first increased, before standard h- and p-adaptives are applied: we suggest to coin this methodology e-adaptivity.

Analytical methods in conjunction with periodic finite element unit cell models are utilized for this task. The finite element models are found to be well suited for all kinds of buckling predictions. Different uni- and bi-axial loadings are considered as well as influences of core height, core material, core geometry, and facesheet thickness are investigated. Finally, a new analytical approach is introduced for the treatment of the rather unexpected core cell wall buckling under in-plane compression of the sandwich, which predicts the critical load very accurately.},

@article{Young2008,
abstract = {Image-based meshing is opening up exciting new possibilities for the application of computational continuum mechanics methods (finite-element and computational fluid dynamics) to a wide range of biomechanical and biomedical problems that were previously intractable owing to the difficulty in obtaining suitably realistic models. Innovative surface and volume mesh generation techniques have recently been developed, which convert three-dimensional imaging data, as obtained from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, micro-CT and ultrasound, for example, directly into meshes suitable for use in physics-based simulations. These techniques have several key advantages, including the ability to robustly generate meshes for topologies of arbitrary complexity (such as bioscaffolds or composite micro-architectures) and with any number of constituent materials (multi-part modelling), providing meshes in which the geometric accuracy of mesh domains is only dependent on the image accuracy (image-based accuracy) and the ability for certain problems to model material inhomogeneity by assigning the properties based on image signal strength. Commonly used mesh generation techniques will be compared with the proposed enhanced volumetric marching cubes (EVoMaCs) approach and some issues specific to simulations based on three-dimensional image data will be discussed. A number of case studies will be presented to illustrate how these techniques can be used effectively across a wide range of problems from characterization of micro-scaffolds through to head impact modelling.},

@article{Guldberg1998,
abstract = {Digital image-based finite element meshing is an alternative approach to time-consuming conventional meshing techniques for generating realistic three-dimensional (3D) models of complex structures. Although not limited to biological applications, digital image-based modeling has been used to generate structure-specific (i.e., non-generic) models of whole bones and trabecular bone microstructures. However, questions remain regarding the solution accuracy provided by the digital meshing approach, particularly at model or material boundaries. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of digital and conventional smooth boundary models based on theoretical solutions for a two-dimensional (2D) compression plate and a 3D circular cantilever beam. For both the plate and beam analyses, the predicted solution at digital model boundaries was characterized by local oscillations, which produced potentially high errors within individual boundary elements. Significantly, however, the digital model boundary solution oscillated approximately about the theoretical solution. A marked improvement in solution accuracy was therefore achieved by considering average results within a region composed of several elements. Absolute errors for Von Mises stress averaged over the beam cross section, for example, converged to less than 4 percent, and the predicted free-end displacement of the cantilever beam was within 1 percent of the theoretical solution. Analyses at several beam orientations and mesh resolutions suggested a minimum discretization of three to four digital finite elements through the beam cross section to avoid high numerical stiffening errors under bending.},

abstract = {The FE-modeling of complex anatomical structures is not solved satisfyingly so far. Voxel-based as opposed to contour-based algorithms allow an automated mesh generation based on the image data. Nonetheless their geometric precision is limited. We developed an automated mesh-generator that combines the advantages of voxel-based generation with improved representation of the geometry by displacement of nodes on the object-surface. Models of an artificial 3D-pipe-section and a skullbase were generated with different mesh-densities using the newly developed geometric, unsmoothed and smoothed voxel generators. Compared to the analytic calculation of the 3D-pipe-section model the normalized RMS error of the surface stress was 0.173-0.647 for the unsmoothed voxel models, 0.111-0.616 for the smoothed voxel models with small volume error and 0.126-0.273 for the geometric models. The highest element-energy error as a criterion for the mesh quality was 2.61x10(-2) N mm, 2.46x10(-2) N mm and 1.81x10(-2) N mm for unsmoothed, smoothed and geometric voxel models, respectively. The geometric model of the 3D-skullbase resulted in the lowest element-energy error and volume error. This algorithm also allowed the best representation of anatomical details. The presented geometric mesh-generator is universally applicable and allows an automated and accurate modeling by combining the advantages of the voxel-technique and of improved surface-modeling.},

@article{sab1992,
abstract = {Due to the increasing capacities of computers, it has become possible to compute the homogenized behaviour of a random medium by the simulation of a representative volume element submitted to homogeneous stress and strain boundary conditions. The present work is devoted to the analysis of the approximations adopted in such a numerical method. The equivalence between stress and strain boundary conditions in the computation of the homogenized properties of an elastic medium is proved without any statistical or periodic assumption on the microstructure. Then, it is established with the aid of a recent ergodic theorem \{[\}Akcoglu \& Krengel, 1981] that the overall properties of a sufficiently large domain in an ergodic random medium are deterministic. Further, if this medium is suitably discretized, then, the Finite Elements computations of these overall properties are also deterministic. This rigorously justifies the fact that one can numerically compute the homogenized properties by the simulation of one single realization of the medium. Of course, such a computation will need a large computer memory size. It is shown however, that even if this memory size is not available, one can always numerically compute more or less sharp bounds which generalize those of Reuss and Voigt. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example, and their generalization to nonlinear behaviours is discussed.},

@article{Moes1999,
abstract = {An improvement of a new technique for modelling cracks in the finite element framework is presented. A standard displacement-based approximation is enriched near a crack by incorporating both discontinuous fields and the near tip asymptotic fields through a partition of unity method. A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation from the interaction of the crack geometry with the mesh is developed. This technique allows the entire crack to be represented independently of the mesh, and so remeshing is not necessary to model crack growth. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed technique. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a critical survey on homogenization theory and related techniques applied to micromechanics. The validation of homogenization results, the characterization of composite materials and the optimal design of complex structures are issues of great technological importance and are viewed here as a combination of mathematical and mechanical homogenization. The mathematical tools for modeling sequentially layered composites are explained. The influence of initial and boundary conditions on the effective properties in nonlinear problems is clarified and the notion of stability by homogenization is analyzed. Multiscale micromechanics methods are outlined and the classical as well as the emerging analytical and computational techniques are presented. Computation of effective static and dynamical properties of materials with linear or nonlinear constitutive equations is closely related to the development of generalized theories such as the strain-gradient mechanics. Selected applications of these techniques are outlined. Moreover, the extension of kinetic techniques in homogenization and the related inverse imaging problem are presented.

@article{Genant2006,
abstract = {Noninvasive and/or nondestructive techniques can provide structural information about bone, beyond simple bone densitometry. While the latter provides important information about osteoporotic fracture risk, many studies indicate that bone mineral density (BMD) only partly explains bone strength. Quantitative assessment of macrostructural characteristics, such as geometry, and microstructural features, such as relative trabecular volume, trabecular spacing, and connectivity, may improve our ability to estimate bone strength. Methods for quantitatively assessing macrostructure include (besides conventional radiographs) dual X ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT), particularly volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT). Methods for assessing microstructure of trabecular bone noninvasively and/or nondestructively include high-resolution computed tomography (hrCT), microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), high-resolution magnetic resonance (hrMR), and micromagnetic resonance (micro-MR). vQCT, hrCT, and hrMR are generally applicable in vivo; micro-CT and micro-MR are principally applicable in vitro. Despite progress, problems remain. The important balances between spatial resolution and sampling size, or between signal-to-noise and radiation dose or acquisition time, need further consideration, as do the complexity and expense of the methods versus their availability and accessibility. Clinically, the challenges for bone imaging include balancing the advantages of simple bone densitometry versus the more complex architectural features of bone, or the deeper research requirements versus the broader clinical needs. The biological differences between the peripheral appendicular skeleton and the central axial skeleton must be further addressed. Finally, the relative merits of these sophisticated imaging techniques must be weighed with respect to their applications as diagnostic procedures, requiring high accuracy or reliability, versus their monitoring applications, requiring high precision or reproducibility.},

@article{Young2008a,
abstract = {Image-based meshing is opening up exciting new possibilities for the application of computational continuum mechanics methods (finite-element and computational fluid dynamics) to a wide range of biomechanical and biomedical problems that were previously intractable owing to the difficulty in obtaining suitably realistic models. Innovative surface and volume mesh generation techniques have recently been developed, which convert three-dimensional imaging data, as obtained from magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, micro-CT and ultrasound, for example, directly into meshes suitable for use in physics-based simulations. These techniques have several key advantages, including the ability to robustly generate meshes for topologies of arbitrary complexity (such as bioscaffolds or composite micro-architectures) and with any number of constituent materials (multi-part modelling), providing meshes in which the geometric accuracy of mesh domains is only dependent on the image accuracy (image-based accuracy) and the ability for certain problems to model material inhomogeneity by assigning the properties based on image signal strength. Commonly used mesh generation techniques will be compared with the proposed enhanced volumetric marching cubes (EVoMaCs) approach and some issues specific to simulations based on three-dimensional image data will be discussed. A number of case studies will be presented to illustrate how these techniques can be used effectively across a wide range of problems from characterization of micro-scaffolds through to head impact modelling.},

@article{Koivu2009,
abstract = {Feasibility of a method for finding flow permeability of porous materials, based on combining computerised X-ray micro-tomography and numerical simulations, is assessed. The permeability is found by solving fluid flow through the complex 3D pore structures obtained by tomography for actual material samples. We estimate overall accuracy of the method and compare numerical and experimental results. Factors contributing to uncertainty of the method include numerical error arising from the finite resolution of tomographic images and the rather small sample size available with the present tomographic techniques. The total uncertainty of computed values of permeability is, however, not essentially larger than that of experimental results. We conclude that the method provides a feasible alternative for finding fluid flow properties of the kind of materials studied. It can be used to estimate all components of permeability tensor and is useful in cases where direct measurements are not achievable. Analogous methods can be applied to other modes of transport, such as diffusion and heat conduction.},

In this paper a new method for the semi-automatic conversion of a stack of CT images of a femur into a CAD solid model is described. This method is relatively simple, accurate, and requires only a 3D CAD plus a few additional programs available in the public domain. The proposed method was used to convert the CT scan data set of a human femur into a valid CAD model; the resulting solid was two times more accurate than that obtained using the commonly used procedure based on 2D segmentation.},

@article{Wang2005,
abstract = {There is a need for the development of finite element (FE) models based on medical datasets, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography in computation biomechanics. Direct conversion of graphic voxels to FE elements is a commonly used method for the generation of FE models. However, conventional voxel-based methods tend to produce models with jagged surfaces. This is a consequence of the inherent characteristics of voxel elements; such a model is unable to capture the geometries of anatomical structures satisfactorily. We have developed a robust technique for the automatic generation of voxel-based patient-specific FE models. Our approach features a novel tetrahedronization scheme that incorporates marching-cubes surface smoothing together with a smooth-distortion factor (SDF). The models conform to the actual geometries of anatomical structures of a lumbar spine segment (L3). The resultant finite element analysis (FEA) at the surfaces is more accurate compared to the use of conventional voxel-based generated FE models. In general, models produced by our method were superior compared to that obtained using the commercial software ScanFE.},

@article{Hollister1994,
abstract = {Bone tissue is a complex multilevel composite which has the ability to sense ad respond to its mechanical environment. It is believed that bone cells called osteocytes within the bone matrix sense the mechanical environment and determine whether structural alterations are needed. At present it is not known, however, how loads are transferred from the whole bone level to cells. A computational procedure combining representative volume element (RVE) based homogenization theory with digital imaging is proposed to estimate strains at various levels of bone structure. Bone tissue structural organization and RVE based analysis are briefly reviewed. The digital image based computational procedure was applied to estimate strains in individual trabeculae (first-level microstructure). Homogenization analysis of an idealized model was used to estimate strains at one level of bone structure around osteocyte lacunae (second-level trabecular microstructure). The results showed that strain at one level of bone structure is amplified to a broad range at the next microstructural level. In one case, a zeor-level tensile principal strain of 495 muE engendered strains ranging between -1000 and 7000 muE in individual trabeculae (first-level microstructure). Subsequently, a first-level tensile principal strains of 1325 muE within an inidividual trabecula engendered strains ranging between 782 and 2530 muE around osteocyte lacunae. Lacunar orientation was found to influence strains around osteocyte lacunae much more than lacunar ellipticity. In conclusion, the computational procedure combining homogenization theory with digital imaging can proveide estimates of cell level strains within whole bones. Such results may be used to bridge experimental studies of bone adaptation at the whole bone and cell culture level. (c) 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This paper clarifies the mathematical structure of this space and its relationship to the underlying spaces associated with each of the random variables. Cases of both dependent and independent basic random variables are addressed. Bases on the product space are developed that can be viewed as generalizations of the standard polynomial chaos approximation.

@article{Zhang2005,
abstract = {This paper describes an algorithm to extract adaptive and quality 3D meshes directly from volumetric imaging data. The extracted tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes are extensively used in the Finite Element Method (FEM). A top-down octree subdivision coupled with the dual contouring method is used to rapidly extract adaptive 3D finite element meshes with correct topology from volumetric imaging data. The edge contraction and smoothing methods are used to improve the mesh quality. The main contribution is extending the dual contouring method to crack-free interval volume 3D meshing with feature sensitive adaptation. Compared to other tetrahedral extraction methods from imaging data, our method generates adaptive and quality 3D meshes without introducing any hanging nodes. The algorithm has been successfully applied to constructing the geometric model of a biomolecule in finite element calculations.},

abstract = {The overall aim of this book is to provide a rigorous means to characterize the microstructure and properties of heterogeneous materials that can simultaneously yield results of practical utility. A unified treatment of both microstructure and properties is emphasized. The book is divided into two parts. Part I deals with the quantitative characterization of the microstructure of heterogeneous via theoretical, computer-simulation and imaging techniques. Emphasis is placed on theoretical methods. Part II treats a wide variety of effective properties of heterogeneous materials and how they are linked to the microstructure. This is accomplished using rigorous methods. Wherever possible, theoretical predictions for the effective properties are compared to available, experimental and computer-simulation data. This book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering.},

@article{Lengsfeld1998,
abstract = {The objectives of the paper presented here is the comparison of a geometry-based and voxel-based finite element (FE) method preprocessor of the human femur. The models were experimentally validated by strain gauge measurements (principal stress). The correlation coefficients (r) between the three methods (geometry-based FEM, voxel-based FEM, strain gauge measurements) were found to be in the range 0.91-0.94 (r2: 0.84-0.88). The relationships between the samples are highly significant (P = 0.001), where the strain gauge results are the independent variables. These results suggest that the validity with respect to the principal stress of a voxel-based modelling is similar to the validity of geometry-based modelling. In summary, therefore, we conclude that voxel-based meshing allows a straightforward interfacing with computerized tomography (CT) scans and might contribute to a clinically applicable FEM technology.},

abstract = {Three acids (HNO3, HNO3/HF and HNO3/HF+H3BO3) were used to decompose gypsum with microwave digestion system. The contents of 10 mineral elements (Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, K, Na, S, Ti, Si and Sr) in gypsum were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) while 6 heavy metals (V, Cr, Mn, Zn, Sc and Ce) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). GBW03109a, GBW03110 and FGD-2 were used as gypsum standard reference materials. The results showed that two-step microwave digestion with HNO3/HF at 210 degrees C and then adding H3BO3 for the removal of HF and fluorides completely decomposed the gypsums, while this method achieved good recoveries for all elements in the three gypsum standard reference materials. The recovery was from 88\% to 112\% and the RSD of tests was below 3\%. The method was applied to the elemental analysis for flue gas desulfurization gypsums from three coal-fired power plants.},

The procedure is an adaptation of the superconvergent patch recovery (SPR) technique for the XFEM framework. It is based oil three fundamental aspects: (a) the use of a singular+smooth stress field decomposition technique involving the use of different recovery methods (or each field: standard SPR for the smooth field and reconstruction of the recovered singular field using the stress intensity factor K for the singular field: (b) direct calculation of smoothed stresses at integation points using conjoint polynomial enhancement and (c) assembly of patches with elements intersected by the crack using different stress interpolation polynomials at each side of the crack. The method was validated by testing it oil problems with an exact solution in mode I, mode II, and mixed mode and oil it problem without analytical solution. The results obtained showed the accuracy of the proposed error estimator. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons. Ltd.},

@article{Viceconti1998a,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate comparatively five methods for automating mesh generation (AMG) when used to mesh a human femur. The five AMG methods considered were: mapped mesh, which provides hexahedral elements through a direct mapping of the element onto the geometry; tetra mesh, which generates tetrahedral elements from a solid model of the object geometry; voxel mesh which builds cubic 8-node elements directly from CT images; and hexa mesh that automatically generated hexahedral elements from a surface definition of the femur geometry. The various methods were tested against two reference models: a simplified geometric model and a proximal femur model. The first model was useful to assess the inherent accuracy of the meshes created by the AMG methods, since an analytical solution was available for the elastic problem of the simplified geometric model. The femur model was used to test the AMG methods in a more realistic condition. The femoral geometry was derived from a reference model (the "standardized femur") and the finite element analyses predictions were compared to experimental measurements. All methods were evaluated in terms of human and computer effort needed to carry out the complete analysis, and in terms of accuracy. The comparison demonstrated that each tested method deserves attention and may be the best for specific situations. The mapped AMG method requires a significant human effort but is very accurate and it allows a tight control of the mesh structure. The tetra AMG method requires a solid model of the object to be analysed but is widely available and accurate. The hexa AMG method requires a significant computer effort but can also be used on polygonal models and is very accurate. The voxel AMG method requires a huge number of elements to reach an accuracy comparable to that of the other methods, but it does not require any pre-processing of the CT dataset to extract the geometry and in some cases may be the only viable solution.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional finite element stress analysis of bone is a key to understanding bone remodelling, assessing fracture risk, and designing prostheses; however, the cost and complexity of predicting the stress field in bone with accuracy has precluded the routine use of this method. A new, automated method of generating patient-specific three-dimensional finite element models of bone is presented — it uses digital computed tomographic (CT) scan data to derive the geometry of the bone and to estimate its inhomogeneous material properties. Cubic elements of a user-specified size are automatically defined and then individually assigned the CT scan-derived material properties. The method is demonstrated by predicting the stress, strain, and strain energy in a human proximal femur in vivo. Three-dimensional loading conditions corresponding to the stance phase of gait were taken from the literature and applied to the model. Maximum principal compressive stresses of 8–23 MPa were computed for the medial femoral neck. Automated generation of additional finite element models with larger numbers of elements was used to verify convergence in strain energy.},

abstract = {A computational homogenization strategy is developed to determine the number of grains necessary to estimate the effective elastic properties of isotropic polycrystalline copper with a given precision. Finite element simulations of polycrystalline aggregates are presented for both homogeneous and periodic boundary conditions. For different volumes, several realizations are considered. The mean apparent shear modulus and the associated dispersion are estimated as a function of the number of grains. Periodic conditions lead to rapid convergence of the result towards the wanted effective shear modulus. The Representative Volume Element (RVE) size is then related to the evolution of the standard deviation of the apparent shear modulus, via an extension of the notion of integral range A(3). For a precision of 1\% and 10 realizations, a minimal RVE size of 445 grains is found. The found value A(3) = 1.43 can be compared to the integral range for other microstructures and physical properties.},

abstract = {We introduce the homotopic alternating sequential filter as a new method for smoothing two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) objects in binary images. Unlike existing methods, our method offers a strict guarantee of topology preservation. This property is ensured by the exclusive use of homotopic transformations defined in the framework of digital topology. Smoothness is obtained by the use of morphological openings and closings by metric disks or balls of increasing radius, in the manner of an alternating sequential filter. The homotopic alternating sequential filter operates both on the object and on the background, in an equilibrated way. It takes an original image X and a control image C as input, and smooths X "as much as possible" while respecting the topology of X and geometrical constraints implicitly represented by C. Based on this filter, we introduce a general smoothing procedure with a single parameter which allows to control the degree of smoothing. Furthermore, the result of this procedure presents small variations in response to small variations of the parameter value. We also propose a method with no parameter for smoothing zoomed binary images In 2D or 3D while preserving topology. (C) 2004 SPIE and IST.},

abstract = {Discontinuous failure is simulated via the introduction of a geometrical discontinuity. The cohesive zone is modelled via the use of the partition-of-unity property of the finite element interpolation. By this approach, a crack can pass through the elements without any restriction to the underlying mesh. Despite such a feature, it has been confirmed that a sufficiently fine mesh discretization still needs to be ensured in order to obtain a correct crack path and mechanical response. The p-adaptive scheme, driven by error in an energy norm measure or a goal-oriented measure, has been examined due to its implementational simplicity. The results have shown that, if considering only increasing the polynomial degree, the p-approach can greatly improve the results. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A framework for variationally consistent homogenization, combined with a generalized macro-homogeneity condition, is exploited for the analysis of non-linear transient heat conduction. Within this framework the classical approach of (model-based) first-order homogenization for stationary problems is extended to transient problems. Homogenization is then carried out in the spatial domain on representative volume elements (RVE), which are (in practice) introduced in quadrature points in standard fashion. Along with the classical averages, a higher order conservation quantity is obtained. An iterative FE²-algorithm is devised for the case of non-linear diffusion and storage coefficients, and it is applied to transient heat conduction in a strongly heterogeneous particle composite. Parametric studies are carried out, in particular with respect to the influence of the ‘internal length’ associated with the second-order conservation quantity.},

abstract = {The concept of material forces pertains to a variation of the inverse motion map while the placement field is kept fixed. From the weak formulation of the self-equilibrating Eshelby (material) stress tensor it turns out that the classical J-integral formulations in fracture mechanics are just special cases due to the choice of particular weight functions. In this contribution, we discuss a posteriori error control of the material forces as part of an adaptive strategy to reduce the discretization error to an acceptable level. The data of the dual problem involves the quite non-conventional tangent stiffness of the (material) Eshelby stress tensor with respect to a variation of the (physical) strain field. The suggested strategy is applied to the common fracture mechanics problem of a single-edged crack, whereby different strategies for computing the J-integral are compared. We also consider the case in which the crack edges are not parallel, i.e. a notch.},

abstract = {We consider combined material model and FE-mesh adaptivity in the context of computational meso–macro-scale modeling (CMM), whereby the coupling between different geometrical scales is taken into account. The macro-scale model is then replaced by the homogenized response of a representative volume element (RVE). In practice, the RVE is analyzed as a “small-scale” finite element problem, which is solved for each (Gauss) point in the domain. The high cost of this strategy clearly motivates the use of adaptive techniques based on a posteriori error estimates for the combined model and discretization error, whereby the solution of an appropriate dual problem is utilized. The suggested adaptive procedure is applied to a particle/matrix composite with hyperelastic constituents.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous structures like composites often need a fine-scale resolution of micro-effects which influence the macroscopic overall response. This is of particular relevance in the fully non-linear range of large strains and inelastic material response of the constituents. Suitable solution methods introduce a multifield scenario of hierarchically superimposed states on different length scales. For big differences of micro- and macro-scales, the argument of scale separation induces the application of homogenization methods. Such types of physical multiscale approaches can be treated by nested multilevel finite element analyses that discretize both the fine-scale micro-structure as well as the macroscopic boundary-value problem. In contrast, small-scale differences require full resolution of the heterogeneous structure. Effective solution methods for the resulting large-scale problems with strongly oscillating properties are suitably designed geometric multigrid techniques, which may be considered as numerical multiscale approaches. In both scenarios, a key ingredient is the suitable formulation of scale bridging algorithms that govern the transfer between different scales. The paper outlines new mesh-bridging techniques in a deformation-driven context for fully non-linear response, which exploit in a non-trivial manner weak constraints on the average deformation in typical finite element patches. The framework is based on an incremental variational structure of finite inelasticity. The proposed new formulations provide variational-based homogenization algorithms for physical multiscale scenarios and problem-dependent optimal finite element grid transfers for numerical multiscale scenarios of heterogeneous materials.},

abstract = {The paper investigates algorithms for the computation of homogenized stresses and overall tangent moduli of microstructures undergoing small strains. Typically, these microstructures define representative volumes of nonlinear heterogeneous materials such as inelastic composites, polycrystalline aggregates or particle assemblies. We consider a priori given discretized microstructures, without focusing on details of specific discretization techniques in space and time. The key contribution of the paper is the construction of a family of algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties of discretized microstructures. It is shown that the overall stresses and tangent moduli of a typical microstructure may exclusively be defined in terms of discrete forces and stiffness properties on the boundary. We focus on deformation-driven microstructures, where the overall macroscopic deformation is controlled. In this context, three classical types of boundary conditions are investigated: (i) linear displacements, (ii) constant tractions and (iii) periodic displacements and antiperiodic tractions. Incorporated by the Lagrangian multiplier method, these constraints generate three classes of algorithms for the computation of equilibrium states and the overall properties of microstructures. The proposed algorithms and matrix representations of the overall properties are formally independent of the interior spatial structure and the local constitutive response of the microstructure and are therefore applicable to a broad class of model problems. We demonstrate their performance for some representative model problems including elastic–plastic deformations of composite materials.},

@article{Peraireetal2006,
abstract = {We present a method for the computation of upper and lower bounds for linear-functional outputs of the exact solutions to the two dimensional elasticity equations. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the well known complementary energy principle. The desired output is cast as the supremum of a quadratic-linear convex functional over an infinite dimensional domain. Using duality the computation of an upper bound for the output of interest is reduced to a feasibility problem for the complementary, or dual, problem. In order to make the problem tractable from a computational perspective two additional relaxations that preserve the bounding properties are introduced. First, the domain is triangulated and a domain decomposition strategy is used to generate a sequence of independent problems to be solved over each triangle. The Lagrange multipliers enforcing continuity are approximated using piecewise linear functions over the edges of the triangulation. Second, the solution of the adjoint problem is approximated over the triangulation using a standard Galerkin finite element approach. A lower bound for the output of interest is computed by repeating the process for the negative of the output. Reversing the sign of the computed upper bound for the negative of the output yields a lower bound for the actual output. The method can be easily generalized to three dimensions. However, a constructive proof for the existence of feasible solutions for the outputs of interest is only given in two dimensions. The computed bound gaps are found to converge optimally, that is, at the same rate as the finite element approximation. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that it allows for a data set to be generated that can be used to certify and document the computed bounds. Using this data set and a simple algorithm, the correctness of the computed bounds can be established without recourse to the original code used to compute them. In the present paper, only computational domains whose boundary is made up of straight sided segments and polynomially varying loads are considered. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the modeling and simulation of the influence of the material substructure on the macroscopic mechanical properties of duplex stainless steel (DSS). Two subscale levels and their interaction are considered: Grain structure (mesoscale) and crystallographic structure (microscale). Typical mesoscale parameters are the volume fraction, morphology and material properties of the two phases (ferrite and austenite). A multiscale modeling approach is adopted, whereby it is assumed that the macro- and mesoscales are separated such that it is possible to model the subscale effects within a representative volume element (RVE) and to obtain the macroscale response via volume averaging (computational homogenization). A new microscale material model based on crystal (visco)plasticity and damage has been developed as part of the thesis work. This model is used to study the evolution of damage within the grain structure of the RVE. The important issue of parameter identification of the material parameters in the crystal plasticity model is also considered. Specifically, the necessary macroscale experiments needed for obtaining a unique set of material parameter values is exploited. Finally, concurrent (FE\$\^{}2\$) multiscale modeling simulations are performed. Different types of plane stress conditions in 2D simulations and the computation of the corresponding macroscale algorithmic tangent stiffness (ATS) tensor are discussed. The concurrent simulations are used for investigating the influence of cold--working on the macroscale mechanical properties for a thin metal sheet with strongly inhomogeneous deformation and stress states.},

From the view of optimization it is convenient to consider the general situation where the governing differential equations may be time-variant and non-linear. Moreover, the choice of parameterization for the sought input, sampling instances of measurement data and discretization of the state problem are all decoupled, in contrast to standard methods such as Dynamic Programming. In this paper, the optimization problem is solved by seeking a stationary point of the pertinent Lagrangian functional, resulting in a Newton-type iterative algorithm. Moreover, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to measurement noise may also be estimated from a perturbation analysis of the optimality conditions. Two numerical examples show that the approach produces results in agreement with those of standard methods, however, with the additional advantage the numerical properties of the considered problem may be investigated. In particular, such knowledge may be used for choosing a proper amount of regularization.},

abstract = {A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network, compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with an efficient, variationally consistent, implementation for rate-independent dissipative solids at finite strain. More precisely, focus is on finite strain plasticity theory based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Adopting the formalism of standard dissipative solids which allows to describe constitutive models by means of only two potentials being the Helmholtz energy and the yield function (or equivalently, a dissipation functional), finite strain plasticity is recast into an equivalent minimization problem. In contrast to previous models, the presented framework covers isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as isotropic and anisotropic elasticity and yield functions. Based on this approach a novel numerical implementation representing the main contribution of the paper is given. In sharp contrast to by now classical approaches such as the return-mapping algorithm and analogously to the theoretical part, the numerical formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all unknown variables follow naturally from minimizing the energy of the considered system. Consequently, several different numerically efficient and robust optimization schemes can be directly employed for solving the resulting minimization problem. Extending previously published works on variational constitutive updates, the advocated model does not rely on any material symmetry and therefore, it can be applied to a broad range of different plasticity theories. As two examples, an anisotropic Hill-type and a Barlat-type model are implemented. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and the performance of the proposed implementation.},

abstract = {The paper investigates computational procedures for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structures of inelastic constituents undergoing small strains. The point of departure is a general internal variable formulation that determines the inelastic response of the constituents of a typical micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in terms of an energy storage and a dissipation function. Consistent with this type of inelasticity we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the local constitutive response where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress potential is obtained from a local minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this local minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We specify the local variational formulation for a setting of smooth single-surface inelasticity and discuss its numerical solution based on a time discretization of the internal variables. The existence of the quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the extension of homogenization approaches of elasticity to the incremental setting of inelasticity. Focusing on macro-strain-driven micro-structures, we develop a new incremental variational formulation of the global homogenization problem where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress potential is obtained from a global minimization problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. It is shown that this global minimization problem determines the state of the micro-structure for finite increments of time. We consider three different settings of the global variational problem for prescribed linear displacements, periodic fluctuations and constant stresses on the boundary of the micro-structure and discuss their numerical solutions based on a spatial discretization of the fine-scale displacement fluctuation field. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated for the model problem of von Mises-type elasto-visco-plasticity of the constituents and applied to a comparative study of micro-to-macro transitions of inelastic composites.},

Solids 38, 813–841 (1990)] for heterogeneous elastic bodies smaller than the representative volume and submitted to static or kinematic uniform boundary conditions are partly extended to the case of mixed boundary conditions. Apparent elastic modulus and compliance tensors denned through the energetic procedure on a single specimen are considered. Through a variational approach, it is shown that each of them is bounded on one side. For cases fulfilling the Hill condition, these apparent modulus and compliance tensors are reciprocals. This provides two-sided bounds on each one. In this case, for a body smaller than the representative volume, the apparent elasticity tensor for mixed boundary conditions falls between the tensors associated with the static and kinematic uniform boundary conditions. Illustrating examples are studied. Various possible fields of application and other extensions are considered.},

abstract = {The material spatial randomness forces one to re-examine various basic concepts of continuum solid mechanics. In this paper we focus on the Representative Volume Element (RVE) that is commonly taken for granted in most of deterministic as well as in stochastic solid mechanics, although in the latter case it is called the Statistical Volume Element (SVE). The key issue is the scale over which homogenization is being carried out—it is called the mesoscale, separating the microscale (level of microheterogeneities) from the macroscale (level of RVE). As the mesoscale grows, the SVE tends to become the RVE. This occurs in terms of two hierarchies of bounds stemming from Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems on the mesoscale, respectively. Since generally there is no periodicity in real random media, the RVE can only be approached approximately on finite scales. We review results on this subject in the settings of linear elasticity, finite elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, thermoelasticity, and permeability.},

A key ingredient is an absolute (fixed) reference configuration, relative to which configurational and deformational changes (rates) with respect to the material (undeformed) and spatial (deformed) configurations, respectively, can be described in a unified fashion. In particular, we are interested in formulating the local as well as global measures of the energy dissipation due to configurational changes of a given physical system. It is believed that the presentation in this paper provides the following advantages: a unified kinematic and thermodynamic setting of the configurational and deformational motions, in particular the generic balance law accounting for configurational flux, increases the general clarity; the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the intrinsic change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation that is induced by configurational changes becomes transparent.

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to present a critical review of available error-controlled adaptive finite element methods—with absolute global and goal-oriented error estimates—for approximate solutions of a given mathematical model and the model error of the considered mathematical model and its dimensions, enhanced with our own recent results in fracture mechanics. The second related important matter is which physical/mathematical models—including various boundary layers and other disturbances—and which accuracy of the finite element solutions in which norm are prescribed and necessary for the safety and reliability of a certain engineering problem, e.g. in structural engineering, of course depending on materials, systems and the type as well as the magnitude of prescribed loadings (i.e. actions in a factorized concept) acting on a specific structure. It is hard to understand why the current regulations for structural engineering design in Europe—especially the European Standards (Eurocodes) and the relevant German DIN-Codes (DIN: Deutsches Institut f\"{u}r Normung e. V.)—do not lay out any rules or bounds for the prescribed accuracy of the material and structural resistance, i.e. the validity of mechanical modelling and the accuracy of associated numerical methods, usually today the finite element method. It can be observed that behind the existing codes there still lies the old thinking of, e.g., classical elastic beam theory of so-called second order for stability problems and the corresponding elastic potential for plates and shells in buckling. Modern flexible finite element modelling by deriving theories in variational form for thin-walled beams, plates and shells from rather general 3D theories, for both linear and non-linear problems, capturing inelastic deformations and layer effects by material and dimensional expansions are not addressed in the Eurocodes for structural engineering. The necessary consequence is that joint work of computational mechanics specialists and structural engineers, working in national and international code-committees, is absolutely necessary, in order to avoid a lot of costly troubles and dangers of today by improving and updating the codes.},

In the most general situation the state variables of the constitutive law, as well as the material parameters, are spatially non-homogeneous. The experimental observations are given in space–time. Based on an appropriate dual problem, we compute a posteriori the discretization error contributions from approximations of the parameter, state and costate fields in space–time for an arbitrarily chosen goal-oriented error measure of engineering significance. Such a measure can be used in an adaptive strategy (not discussed in this paper) to meet a predefined error tolerance. An important observation is that the Jacobian matrix associated with the resulting Newton method is used (in principle) in solving the dual problem. Rather than treating the Jacobian in a monolithic fashion, we utilize a sequential solution strategy, whereby the FE-topology of the discretized state problem is used repeatedly. Moreover, the proposed solution strategy lends itself naturally to the computation of first and second order sensitivities, which are obtained with little extra computational effort. Numerical results are given for the prototype model of confined aquifer flow with spatially non-homogeneous permeability. The efficiency of the optimization strategy and the effectivity of the error computation are assessed.},

The framework involves the formulation of an optimization problem as the stationarity condition for a Lagrangian, whose arguments include an additional costate field in order to incorporate the state equation. This formulation has two distinct advantages: (1) The sensitivity of parameters with respect to uncertainties in the observed data can be assessed efficiently using a dual method, which compares favorably with the more conventional primal method, and (2) The errors arising from the FE discretization can be computed using the same dual method, which is an additional bonus. In fact, both the sensitivity and the discretization error can be estimated in an arbitrarily chosen “goal quantity” (or quantity of interest). Two numerical problems, one in terms of stationary groundwater flow (elliptic, in space) and another in terms of transient moisture diffusion in wood (parabolic, in space-time) illustrate the salient features of the proposed algorithm(s).},

All microstructures generated by the algorithm are in static and configurational equilibrium. Owing to the continuity constraint imposed upon the microstructural evolution, the predicted material behavior may be path-dependent and exhibit hysteresis. In cases in which there is a strict separation of micro- and macrostructural lengthscales, the proposed relaxation algorithm may effectively be integrated into macroscopic finite-element calculations at the sub-grid level. We demonstrate this aspect of the algorithm by means of a numerical example concerned with the indentation of a Cu–Al–Ni shape memory alloy by a spherical indenter.},

This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill-Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},

abstract = {Goal-oriented a posteriori error estimators are presented in this paper for the error obtained while approximately evaluating the J-integral in linear elastic fracture mechanics using the finite element method. The J-integral provides a criterion for crack propagation of a pre-existing crack. Therefore, its reliable and accurate evaluation is of considerable importance in engineering applications to prevent failure of structures. This can be achieved by goal-oriented adaptive finite element methods based on the well-established strategy of solving an auxiliary dual problem in order to control the error of a (non)linear functional, here the J-integral. In this paper, two principally different goal-oriented adaptive strategies are presented. The first strategy rests upon equilibrated residual error estimators based on local Neumann problems, whereas the second one makes use of averaging techniques. The paper is concluded by a numerical example that illustrates our theoretical results.},

abstract = {The interest in adaptive strategies for the finite element method is growing at a fast pace. Researchers are now fully convinced that this should be part of any numerical modelling and try to incorporate the methodology to their problems. Even the industry begins to require such an approach to increase the quality of the numerical results and to get more effective analyses to increase the ratio between computer costs and target error level. The adaptive strategy has first been applied to linear elliptic problems, e.g. linear infinitesimal elasticity [1,6,17,11]). It is now enlarged to nonlinear and transient problems [12–16,5,10,17]. It is the aim of this paper to illustrate the application of the technique of residuals to adaptive refinement of coupled problems and to elastic wave propagation. There are many other approaches to a posteriori error estimations. Some of them appear to be difficult to extend to coupled and transient problems. It is believed that the residual approach is versatile enough to be easily applied to more complex problems. The two basic ideas used here rely on a space-time Galerkin formulation which provides a variational formulation of the error with respect to the residual, and the adjoint state which gives an upper bound of the error by the norm of the residuals weighted by some power of h and $\Delta$t, extending the ideas of Eriksson et al. [5].},

The new solution approach decomposes the hybrid system into a hierarchical global-local problem consisting of a positive definite global problem and an indefinite local system that are derived using minimization on the subspace and the stationarity principle, respectively. An innovative transformation of the indefinite local problem into an equivalent symmetric positive definite system makes the solution of the local problem possible either by a direct solver without pivoting or by a preconditioned iterative method. Alternative semi-iterative solution procedures for the case when auxiliary coarse grid is not available, are also developed. This includes a multigrid-like scheme that uses a mathematical model based on the collocation formulation as the auxiliary grid. Numerical performance studies for two-dimensional plane stress and shell problems are carried out to test the usefulness of the proposed procedures.},

A rational interface theory based on damage development coupled to inelastic slip and dilatation is developed. The theory uses the interface width as a constitutive parameter, which regularizes the theory of LEMAITRE [1992], that is restricted to perfect bond between grain and matrix. In a series of FE-analyses parameter variations were performed: The unit cell size (as compared to the average grain diameter), the grain-matrix area ratio, the interface width and constitutive parameters. It appears that the composite behavior can be designed as brittle or ductile solely depending on the strength and rate of damage development in the interfaces. A localization band was detected, and its orientation is in the range that is predicted within continuum theory.},

In this paper, adaptive mesh refinement based on the pertinent dual solution is used in order to reduce discretization errors in the calibrated material parameters. By a sensitivity assessment, the influence from uncertainties in experimental data is estimated, which serves as a threshold under which there is no need to further reduce the discretization error. The adaptive strategy is employed to calibrate a viscoelasticity model with observed data from uniaxial compression (i.e., homogeneous stress state), where the FE-discretization in time is studied.

abstract = {Modeling of elastic thin-walled beams, plates and shells as ID- and 2D-boundary value problems is valid in undisturbed subdomains. Disturbances near supports and free edges, in the vicinity of concentrated loads and at thickness jumps cannot be described in a sufficient way by 1D- and 2D-BVPs. In these disturbed subdomains dimensional (d)-adaptivity and model (m)-adaptivity have to be performed coupled with h- and/or p-adaptivity using hierarchically expanded test spaces in order to guarantee reliable and efficient overall results. The expansion strategy is applied for enhancing the spatial dimension and the model which is more efficient and evident for engineers than the reduction method. Using local residual error estimators of the primal problem in the energy norm by solving Dirichlet-problems on element patches, an efficient integrated adaptive calculation of the discretization—and the dimensional error is possible and reasonable, demonstrated by examples. We also present an error estimator of the dual problem, namely a posterior equilibrium method (PEM) for calculation of the interface tractions on local patches with Neumann boundary conditions, using orthogonality conditions. These tractions are equilibrated with respect to the global equilibrium condition of the stress resultants. An upper bound error estimator based on differences between the new tractions and the discontinuous tractions calculated from the stresses of the current finite element solution. The introduction of new element boundary tractions yields a method which can be regarded as a stepwise hybrid displacement method or as Trefftz method for local Neumann problems of element patches. An important advantage of PEM is the coupled computation of local discretization, dimensional- and model errors by an additive split.},

@article{Hettigetal2007,
abstract = {Composites or multi-phase materials are characterized by a distinct heterogeneous microstructure. The failure modes of these materials are governed by several micromechanical effects like debonding phenomena and matrix cracks. The overall mechanical behavior of composites in the linear as well as the nonlinear regime is not only governed by the material properties of the components and their bonds but also by the material layout. In the present contribution the material structure is resolved and modeled on a small scale allowing to deal with these effects. For the numerical simulation we apply a combination of the extended finite-element method (X-FEM) [N. Mo\"{e}s, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 46 (1999) 131–150] and the level set method (LSM) [S. Osher, J. Sethian, Fronts propagating with curvature dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton–Jacobi formulations, J. Comput. Phys. 79 (1988) 12–49]. In the X-FEM the finite-element approximation is enriched by appropriate functions through the concept of partition of unity. The geometry of material interfaces and cracks is described by the LSM. The combination of both, X-FEM and LSM, turns out to be very natural since the enrichment can be described and even constructed in terms of level set functions. In order to project the material behavior modeled on a small scale onto the large or structural scale, we employ the variational multiscale method (VMM) [T. Hughes, G. Feijoo, L. Mazzei, J.-B. Quiney, The variational multiscale method – a paradigm for computational mechanics, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 166 (1998) 3–24]. This concept is based on an additive split of the displacement field into large and small scale parts. For an efficient solution of the discrete problem we postulate that the small scale displacements are locally supported; in order to achieve this objective one has to assume appropriate constraint conditions. It can be shown that the applied numerical model allows a considerable flexibility concerning the variation of the material design and consequently of the mechanical behavior of a composite.},

Due to the high memory allocation costs that the condensation procedure induces, a perturbation procedure is developed based on a minimal number of micromechanical tests. Results from the condensation and perturbation procedures are compared for sample infinitesimal and finite deformation inelasticity problems and the algorithmic consistency of the macroscopic tangent with the evolution of the macroscopic stress is discussed.

The strategy is based on an optimization problem expressed such that the state equation is incorporated via an additional costate field, which has the distinct advantage that error control in an arbitrary “goal” quantity is formally straightforward. The practical solution of the optimization problem is essentially based on Newton's method, which is feasible since it is possible to decompose each Newton step in a number of linear problems using the conventional finite element structure for the RVE problem. The same problem character is pertinent to the solution of the dual problem for a given choice of error measure, which is the key ingredient in the a posteriori error computation. The numerical results show the effectivity of the error prediction for the special case when the material parameters are constant within the subdomains of mesostructural constituents.},

The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-structure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals.},

abstract = {Mixed atomistic and continuum methods offer the possibility of carrying out simulations of material properties at both larger length scales and longer times than direct atomistic calculations. The quasicontinuum method links atomistic and continuum models through the device of the finite element method which permits a reduction of the full set of atomistic degrees of freedom. The present paper gives a full description of the quasicontinuum method, with special reference to the ways in which the method may be used to model crystals with more than a single grain. The formulation is validated in terms of a series of calculations on grain boundary structure and energetics. The method is then illustrated in terms of the motion of a stepped twin boundary where a critical stress for the boundary motion is calculated and nanoindentation into a solid containing a subsurface grain boundary to study the interaction of dislocations with grain boundaries.},

abstract = {Recently a refined approach to error control in finite element (FE) discretisations has been proposed, Becker and Rannacher (1995b), (1996), which uses weighted a posteriori error estimates derived via duality arguments. The conventional strategies for mesh refinement in FE models of problems from elasticity theory are mostly based on a posteriori error estimates in the energy norm. Such estimates reflect the approximation properties of the finite element ansatz by local interpolation constants while the stability properties of the continuous model enter through a global coercivity constant. However, meshes generated on the basis of such global error estimates are not appropriate in cases where the domain consists of very heterogeneous materials and for the computation of local quantities, e.g., point values or contour integrals. This deficiency is cured by using certain local norms of the dual solution directly as weights multiplying the local residuals of the computed solution. In general, these weights have to be evaluated numerically in the course of the refinement process, yielding almost optimal meshes for various kinds of error measures. This feed-back approach is developed here for primal as well as mixed FE discretisations of the fundamental problem in linear elasticity.},

The present paper extends this methodology to heat conduction problems. The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail.

Generally, residual error estimators (which have at least upper bound in contrast to indicators) can be locally computed from residua of equilibrium and stress-jumps at element interfaces using Dirichlet or Neumann conditions for element patches or individual elements (REM). Another equivalent method for error estimation can be derived from a posteriori computed improved boundary tractions which provide exact equilibrium of elements. They are computed from local Neumann problems and yield improved local solution by testing with higher test functions. This method is called Posterior Equilibrium Method (PEM) and yields better efficiency indices than REM for the investigated problem, even in case of locking. Also, the important feature of model-adaptivity via hierarchical error estimation can only be realized by this strategy. Global Neumann-type estimators and examples are presented for elastic and elastoplastic deformations, controlling equilibrium in tangential space.},

The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed constitutive updates is that, by construction, the corresponding incremental stress—strain relations derive from a pseudo-elastic strain-energy density. This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy.},

abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the development of three-dimensional ﬁnite element formulations suitable for the analysis of material failure at ﬁnite strains. Focus is on the simulation of complex failure patterns. For that purpose, a cohesive-type constitutive model is adopted and further elaborated. More precisely, a traction-separation law connecting the stress vector acting at a certain surface to a displacement jump such as a crack opening displacement is considered. A numerically eﬃcient implementation of this non-standard model is one of the ultimate goals of the present thesis. The advocated ﬁnite element formulation allows for a broad range of diﬀerent constitutive models. Furthermore, no restrictions regarding the space of the continuous displacement approximations are required, i.e., higher-order polynomials can be applied as well. For estimating the quality of the numerical solution a novel class of adaptive methods is presented in the second part of the thesis. Assuming the considered mechanical problem is driven by a variational principle such as energy minimization, so-called variational adaptive ﬁnite element formulations are developed. Within those methods, the state variables and the deformation mapping as well as an improved discretization are computed from the same overriding principle. The performance of those variational mesh adaptions is illustrated by means of two prototypes: variational r-adaptivity and variational h-adaptivity. Finally, the coupling of cohesive ﬁnite element formulations and variational mesh adaption is brieﬂy discussed.},

For example, the mechanical properties of a cast component depend strongly on the casting process, the simulation of which requires complex modeling at a high LOD. In this article, we propose an optimization strategy that is based on the LOD concept to develop cost-effective components. A sizing optimization of a cast model component is carried out with respect to both the mechanical and thermal response to exemplify the process. In particular, a (novel) global measure of the temperature in energy norm is introduced as an indicator of the “production fitness” to ensure high quality of the material properties.

Considering each grain individually allows us to characterise the effect of the surrounding grains. Finally, an analysis of the results inside the grains provides information about the relative contributions of the core of the grain and the grain boundary to the deformation/hardening process.

This occurs when the resolution of micro and macro scale does not differ ab initio or when evolving fluctuations in the macro-fields are in the order of the micro scale during the loading progress. Typical examples are localization phenomena. The objective of the present study is to develop an efficient solution method exploiting the physically existing multiscale character of the problem. The proposed method belongs to the superposition-based methods with local enrichment of the large-scale solution ū by a small-scale part u′. The main focus of the present formulation is to allow for locality of the small-scale solution within the large-scale elements to achieve an efficient solution strategy. At the same time the small-scale information exchange over the large-scale element boundaries is facilitated while maintaining the accuracy of a refined complete solution. Thus, the emphasis lies on finding appropriate locality constraints for u′.

We derive space-time FE-methods based on the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin method in time for the energy equation. This formulation integrates the stored energy exactly for a given heat flux. When macro-segregation is incorporated into the model, the problem can be formulated in such a way that the phase-transition drives a flow of species. In addition, diffusion is possible throughout the domain. The model can be further rewritten using a potential approach. By this approach for modelling macro-segregation, we are able to obtain discretizations that guarantee that the balance equations are satisfied, and it is possible to solve the phase-transition problem either as a field problem or as a local problem (defined by a local evolution rule).},
